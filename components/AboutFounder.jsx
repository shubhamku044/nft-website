          Hello there! My name is Mina, I am the founder & artist behind
          WonderPals. I am a freelance artist and senior product designer with
          nearly 10 years of experience in design, e-commerce & marketing,
          working with companies like Tiffany & Co., Target, Pinterest, and
          more! My work has always revolved around the development of visual
          languages & branding with the goal of bringing delightful experiences
          to everyone. Expressing positivity through my art is what I truly love
          to do. I have always been a creator of cute characters and calming
          aesthetics. When I first started designing WonderPals, I wanted to
          create a lovable character that anyone could identify with no matter
          their age, gender, or nationality. A WonderPal can be anything it
          wants to be, and so can you! I hope to continue my journey as an
          artist through this new project with the support of the amazing
          community we are building. I have big dreams for WonderPals and I am
          so thankful for the overwhelming support we have gotten so far! I am
          excited for what the future holds.
