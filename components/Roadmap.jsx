          We will continue to create delightful art and work on developing &
          growing our community and the WonderPals brand. We have plans to open
          an online gift shop with an array of products & collectibles that will
          include items like apparel, plushies, stickers, and more! We will be
          collaborating with various projects & talented artists, and will be
          working together to contribute to our futureCollabs Collection. We
          have many ideas for the future of WonderPals, so join us on this
          journey as we launch our project and expand the WonderPals universe!
